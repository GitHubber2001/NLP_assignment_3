# Reproducibility notes
The training, evaluation metrics, and error analysis outputs given by the program are deterministic due to the fixed random seed used. To reproduce our results use the Bash commands listed below in sequence in a terminal to download the repository and run the program. To execute these commands successfully you need to have Git, the uv package manager and Python 3.12 or higher installed.
